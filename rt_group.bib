  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the ANT produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The ANT may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

	abstract = {According to the conflict-monitoring model of cognitive control, the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) plays an important role in detecting conflict between competing motor responses. Consistent with this view, pMFC activity is greater in high-conflict trials (e.g., incongruent trials and errors) than in low-conflict trials (e.g., congruent trials and correct responses) of distractor interference tasks. However, in both low- and high-conflict trials, pMFC activity increases linearly with reaction time (RT).Thus, heightened pMFC activity in high-conflict trials may simply reflect the fact that mean RT is longer in high-conflict than in low-conflict trials. To investigate this hypothesis, we reanalyzed data from a previously published fMRI study in which participants performed an event-related version of the multi-source interference task. Critically, after controlling for conditional differences in mean RT, effects of response congruency on pMFC activity were eliminated; in contrast, effects of response accuracy on pMFC activity remained robust. These findings indicate that effects of response congruency on pMFC activity may index any of several processes whose recruitment increases with time on task (e.g., sustained attention). However, effects of response accuracy reflect processes unique to error trials. We conclude that effects of response accuracy on pMFC activity provide stronger support for the conflict-monitoring model than effects of response congruency.},

In line with this view, pMFC activity is ubiquitously greater in incongruent trials of responseinterference (e.g., Stroop) tasks than in congruent trials. Nonetheless, the process underlying this congruency effect remains highly controversial. We therefore sought to distinguish between two competing accounts of the congruency effect. The conflict monitoring account posits the effect indexes a process that detects conflict between competing response alternatives, which is indexed by trial-specific reaction time (RT). The time on task account posits the effect indexes a process whose recruitment increases with time on task independent of response conflict (e.g., sustained attention, arousal, effort, etc.). To distinguish between these accounts, we used functional MRI to record brain activity in twenty-four healthy adults while they performed two tasks: a response-interference task and a simple RT task with only one possible response. We reasoned that demands on a process that detects response conflict should increase with RT in the response-interference task but not in the simple RT task. In contrast, demands on a process whose recruitment increases with time on task independent of response conflict should increase with RT in both tasks. Trial-by-trial analyses revealed that pMFC activity increased with RT in both tasks. Moreover, pMFC activity increased with RT in the simple RT task enough to fully account for the congruency effect in the response-interference task. These findings appear more consistent with the time on task account of the congruency effect than with the conflict monitoring account.},

Here, we discuss several errors in their methods and conclusions and show, contrary to their claims, that their Ô¨Åndings are entirely consistent with previously published predictions of the conÔ¨Çict monitoring theory. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we point out that their argument rests on the assumption that conÔ¨Çict must be greater on all incongruent trials than on all congruent trials‚Äîan assumption that is theoretically and demonstrably incorrect. We also point out that their simulations are Ô¨Çawed and diverge substantially from previously published implementations of the conÔ¨Çict monitoring theory. When simulated appropriately, the conÔ¨Çict monitoring theory predicts precisely the patterns of results that Grinband et al. take to present serious challenges to the theory. Finally, we note that their proposal that dMFC activity reÔ¨Çects time on task is theoretically weak, pointing to a direct relationship between behavior (RT) and neural activity but failing to identify any intervening psychological construct to relate the two. The conÔ¨Çict monitoring theory provides such a construct, and a mechanistic implementation that continues to receive strong support from the neuroimaging literature, including the results reported by Grinband et al.},

	abstract = {In neuroimaging research on attention, cognitive control, decision-making, and other areas where response time (RT) is a critical variable, the temporal variability associated with the decision is often assumed to be inconsequential to the hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related designs. On this basis, the majority of published studies model brain activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing the onset of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved with the hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However, electrophysiological studies have shown that decision-related neuronal activity is not instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts until the motor response. It is therefore possible that small differences in neural processing durations, similar to human RTs, will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and therefore in the results of regression analyses. In this study we compare the effectiveness of traditional models that assume no temporal variance with a model that explicitly accounts for the duration of very brief epochs of neural activity. Using both simulations and fMRI data, we show that brief differences in duration are detectable, making it possible to dissociate the effects of stimulus intensity from stimulus duration, and that optimizing the model for the type of activity being detected improves the statistical power, consistency, and interpretability of results.},

The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task functional MRI (fMRI) is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures.

	abstract = {Background: Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used measures of performance in experimental psychology, yet relatively few fMRI studies have included trial-by-trial differences in RT as a predictor variable in their analyses. Using a multistudy approach, we investigated whether there are brain regions that show a general relationship between trial-by-trial RT variability and activation across a range of cognitive tasks.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The relation between trial-by-trial differences in RT and brain activation was modeled in five different fMRI datasets spanning a range of experimental tasks and stimulus modalities. Three main findings were identified. First, in a widely distributed set of gray and white matter regions, activation was delayed on trials with long RTs relative to short RTs, suggesting delayed initiation of underlying physiological processes. Second, in lateral and medial frontal regions, activation showed a ‚Äò‚Äòtime-on-task‚Äô‚Äô effect, increasing linearly as a function of RT. Finally, RT variability reliably modulated the BOLD signal not only in gray matter but also in diffuse regions of white matter.
Conclusions/Significance: The results highlight the importance of modeling trial-by-trial RT in fMRI analyses and raise the possibility that RT variability may provide a powerful probe for investigating the previously elusive white matter BOLD signal.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Working memory has been examined extensively using the N-back task. However, less is known about the neural bases underlying individual variation in the accuracy rate (AR) and reaction time (RT) as metrics of N-back performance. Whereas AR indexes the overall performance, RT may more specifically reflect the efficiency in updating target identify. Further, studies have associated fluid intelligence (Gf) with working memory, but the cerebral correlates shared between Gf and N-back performance remain unclear. We addressed these issues using the Human Connectome Project dataset. We quantified the differences in AR (critical success index or CSI) and RT between 2- and 0-backs (CSI
              2‚Äì0
              and RT
              2‚Äì0
              ) and identified the neural correlates of individual variation in CSI

              , RT
              2‚Äì0
              , and Gf, as indexed by the number of correct items scored in the Raven‚Äôs Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test. The results showed that CSI
              2‚Äì0
              and RT
              2‚Äì0
              were negatively correlated, suggesting that a prolonged response time did not facilitate accuracy. At voxel p‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.05, FWE-corrected, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), bilateral frontoparietal cortex (biFPC) and right anterior insula (rAI) showed activities in negative correlation with CSI
              2‚Äì0
              and positive correlation with RT
              2‚Äì0
              . In contrast, a cluster in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) bordering the SMA showed activities in positive correlation with CSI
              2‚Äì0
              and negative correlation with RT
              2‚Äì0
              . Further, path analyses showed a significant fit of the model dACC‚Äâ‚Üí‚ÄâRT
              2‚Äì0
              ‚Äâ‚Üí‚ÄâCSI
              2‚Äì0,
              suggesting a critical role of target switching in determining performance accuracy. Individual variations in RT
              2‚Äì0
              and Gf were positively correlated, although the effect size was small (f
              2
              ‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0246). RT
              2‚Äì0
              and Gf shared activities both in positive correlation with the preSMA, biFPC, rAI, and dorsal precuneus. These results together suggest inter-related neural substrates of individual variation in N-back performance and highlight a complex relationship in the neural processes supporting 2-back and RSPM performance.},

	abstract = {The dorsal medial frontal cortex (dMFC) is highly active during choice behavior. Though many models have been proposed to explain dMFC function, the conÔ¨Çict monitoring model is the most inÔ¨Çuential. It posits that dMFC is primarily involved in detecting interference between competing responses thus signaling the need for control. It accurately predicts increased neural activity and response time (RT) for incompatible (highinterference) vs. compatible (low-interference) decisions. However, it has been shown that neural activity can increase with time on task, even when no decisions are made. Thus, the greater dMFC activity on incompatible trials may stem from longer RTs rather than response conÔ¨Çict. This study shows that (1) the conÔ¨Çict monitoring model fails to predict the relationship between error likelihood and RT, and (2) the dMFC activity is not sensitive to congruency, error likelihood, or response conÔ¨Çict, but is monotonically related to time on task.},

However, even when groups are matched for performance, they may differ in terms of the RT‚ÄìBOLD relationship: the degree to which brain activity varies with RT on a trial-by-trial basis. Group activation differences might therefore be influenced by group differences in the relationship between brain activity and time on task. Here, we investigated whether correcting for this potential confound alters group differences in brain activity. Specifically, we reanalyzed data from a functional MRI study of response conflict in children and adults, in which conventional analyses indicated that conflict-related activity did not differ between groups. We found that the RT‚ÄìBOLD relationship was weaker in children than in adults. Consequently, after removing the effect of RT on brain activity, children exhibited greater conflict-related activity than adults in both the posterior medial prefrontal cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results identify the RT‚ÄìBOLD relationship as an important potential confound in fMRI studies of group differences. They also suggest that the magnitude of the RT‚ÄìBOLD relationship may be a useful biomarker of brain maturity.},
